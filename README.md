## ‚ö° üíò üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Supercharge your Training with PyTorch Lightning + Weights & Biases
In this repository we provide customized implementation of the 3DUnet to make segmentation for task Brain Tumor Segmentation in mpMRI scans using dataset from RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS 2021 challenge.

## DATASET
  All BraTS mpMRI scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz). These mpMRI scans describe a) native (T1) and b) post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd), c) T2-weighted (T2), and d) T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (T2-FLAIR) volumes, and were acquired with different clinical protocols and various scanners from multiple institutions. The sub-regions considered for evaluation are the "enhancing tumor" (ET), the "tumor core" (TC), and the "whole tumor" (WT). The ground truth data were created after their pre-processing, i.e., co-registered to the same anatomical template, interpolated to the same resolution (1 mm^3) and skull-stripped.
 
## How to use
Make sure you have an account in Weights & Biases and you have installed the PyTorch Lightning, as this implementation is written with their support.

## Run training

You can train the model with
```python
python train.py 
```
You'd better change some of the default parameters. First of all, you should customize the name of the experiment and project, redefine the paths to data and output:

  - weights_stem - the experiment's name, by default W&B generate a random two-word name that lets you easily cross-reference runs   - project_name - the project name 
  - group_name -  to specify a group to organize individual runs into a larger experiment
  
  - data_path - path to the data folder with subjects
  - weights_save_path - output path
  - resume_from_checkpoint - path to load weights
  
You can also change the datalogger settings and try to play with the model:
  - training_batch_size/validation_batch_size, patch_size, patch_overlap, samples_per_volume, max_queue_length, data_augmentation_train, data_augmentation_val - to customize data
  - in_channels, num_encoding_blocks, out_channels_first_layer, preactivation, upsampling, activation - to customize model
  - learning_rate, max_epochs, weight_decay, momentum, tolerance, patience - to customize experiment
  
For the first time it would be a good idea to run the training with the --fast_dev_run parameter to make sure the code works without errors, before running the full experiment.

```python
python train.py --fast_dev_run True
```
- runs 1 train, val, test batch and program ends.
  

## A lit prompt for working with Pytorch lightning.

A LightningModule organizes your PyTorch code into some sections.
For readability of the code, I separated the loading and processing of data from the model itself.
Thus, there is a separate class for data, which standardizes the training, val, test splits, data preparation and transforms. If you want to run training on a different dataset, you need to write your own class, in which it must necessarily be defined 4 key methods: prepare_data, setup, train_dataloader, val_dataloader. 

For details refer to Pytorch Lightning [documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pytorch_lightning.core.datamodule.html#pytorch_lightning.core.datamodule.LightningDataModule)

  
Just a reminder, the model class, as The LightningModule, includes the following methods:
    - forward
    - training_step
    - validation_step
    - test step
    - configure_optimizers
    
Besides, under the hood, the Lightning Trainer handles the training loop details for you, some examples include:

    - Automatically enabling/disabling grads

    - Running the training, validation and test dataloaders

    - Calling the Callbacks at the appropriate times

    - Putting batches and computations on the correct devices
